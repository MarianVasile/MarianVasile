- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a VSCode extension and a few related server/infa components, that will enable programmers to become aware of each other's code, in wonderful ways. At the moment I'm struggling with creating a new, secure way to partition the access to private repositories, without requesting access to it (i.e. no GitHub API and such).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swift

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @markvasile or @codeawareness
